# **SQL Data Exploration: Famous Paintings**

I selected the famous paintings dataset available on Kaggle, comprising seven tables: Artist, Canvas_Size, Museum, Museum_Hours, Price_Size, Subject, and Work. My choice of this dataset stems from a personal interest in art and paintings. Leveraging SQL queries, I delved into the dataset to gain insights by answering specific questions related to the world of art.
